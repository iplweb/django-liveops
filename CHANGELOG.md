# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here. The format is based
on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0]

### Added
- **Default component stylesheet** (`liveops/static/liveops/liveops.css`). The
  package now ships a neutral, framework-agnostic default look for the
  live-operation UI — progress bar (grey track + coloured fill with a width
  transition), stage stepper pills (blue active / green done / red
  failed·cancelled), status line, monospace scrollable log, result box, and
  the cancel/retry controls — plus `:empty` hiding so unused regions don't
  reserve space. The built-in `liveops/operation.html` template loads it
  automatically next to `liveops.js`. It's pure low-specificity CSS (no SCSS,
  no Foundation/Bootstrap/Tailwind dependency), so a host can override any rule
  from a later stylesheet or skip the link and style the semantic classes
  directly. Previously the package shipped only JS and every host styled the
  components from scratch.

## [0.3.0]

### Added
- `liveops.testing.MockProgress` — a recording, transport-free `Progress`
  double for unit-testing a `LiveOperation.run(self, p)` without a channel
  layer, Redis, or a worker. Records status/log/percent/stages/result/error
  for assertions, finalizes the operation on `result()`/`error()`, and
  supports simulated cancellation via `cancel_after=N`.
- `LiveOperation.get_success_url()` — return a URL to auto-redirect the browser
  to when the operation finishes successfully (default `None` keeps the user on
  the live page). Carried in the `liveop_finished` signal as `success_url`;
  `liveops.js` navigates there on `FINISHED_OK`, letting a consumer skip the
  operations index and land on a dedicated page.
- `pairs` template filter — iterate a dict in templates immune to a key named
  `items`/`keys`/`values` (`{% for k, v in d|pairs %}`).

### Changed
- Cancel/Retry are now htmx buttons (no full-page reload); the UI updates over
  the WebSocket. CSRF travels as an `X-CSRFToken` header injected from the
  cookie by `liveops.js`, so it also works on WS-pushed chained containers.
  Cancel/Restart views return `204` for htmx (redirect only as no-JS fallback);
  `LiveOperationView` sets the CSRF cookie via `ensure_csrf_cookie`.

### Fixed
- **CSRF on cancel/restart**: the `{% live_operation %}` templatetag rendered
  the fragment without the request, so `{% csrf_token %}` produced an empty
  token and no CSRF cookie was set — every cancel/restart POST failed CSRF.
  The templatetag now renders with the request.
- **Blank result region**: a `result_context` key literally named `items`
  made `{% for k, v in ctx.items %}` resolve to the value (dict-key lookup
  shadows the method) and raise `TypeError`. The default result template now
  uses `|pairs`.

## [0.2.0]

### Changed
- **BREAKING — central op_type routing.** The `liveops:live`, `liveops:cancel`
  and `liveops:restart` URLs now carry an `op_type` segment
  (`<app_label>.<model_name>`), and `LiveOperation.get_absolute_url()` includes
  it. `liveops.urls` now ships these three **generic** patterns — mount them
  **once** in the project root (`path("live/", include("liveops.urls"))`) and
  they serve *every* `LiveOperation` subclass via an O(1) `apps.get_model`
  lookup. Consumer apps no longer subclass `LiveOperationView` /
  `CancelView` / `RestartView` per model, and no longer register their own
  `liveops`-namespaced URLs for them (only `create`/`list`, which need a
  form/model, stay app-specific).
  - Migration: replace per-app `live/cancel/restart` URL entries with a single
    `include("liveops.urls")`; drop the per-model view subclasses.

### Added
- `LiveOperation.op_type_key()` — stable, reversible key used for routing.
- `LiveOperation.on_restart()` — model hook called by `RestartView` before it
  resets state and re-enqueues (override to clean up child records).
- Superusers are now exempt from the `LIVEOPS["REQUIRED_GROUP"]` gate
  (matches Django admin / django-braces semantics).

## [0.1.0]

### Added
- Initial release of **django-liveops**.
- `LiveOperation` abstract model + ergonomic `run(self, p)` API.
- `Progress` with pluggable backends: `WebProgress` (WebSocket + HTML
  out-of-band swaps, no reload, no polling) and `TextProgress` (tqdm/CLI).
- Live progress API: `status`, `percent`, `track` (tqdm-style), `log`,
  `stage` (multi-stage stepper), `result`, `error`, `check_cancelled`,
  `chain_to` (chain operations without reload); web-only `swap`/`html`.
- Transport via `django-channels-broadcast` (`addMessage` OOB-swap plugin);
  HTML in a JSON envelope; snapshot-on-connect (terminal state = source of
  truth); subscription tokens binding a user to one operation channel.
- Reusable class-based views + `{% live_operation %}` templatetag +
  auto-derived templates/channel names.
- `run_liveop` management command (text/CLI mode).
- Example demo project with one-command Docker stack (`make demo`).
- Full MkDocs documentation and a three-tier test suite (consumer unit,
  `Progress` unit, worker→Redis round-trip via testcontainers).
